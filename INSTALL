Requirements

  Python 2.6 or 2.7.

  Zope Interface 3.6.0 or better (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface)

  pyOpenSSL (<https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl>) is required for any SSL APIs.
  On Windows, version 0.10 or newer is required.  pyOpenSSL 0.10 or newer is
  also preferred on other platforms, but older versions will work as well.

  Hostname verification requires pyOpenSSL 0.12 or later, as well as the
  pyasn1 and pyasn1_modules.  pyasn1 is also required for Conch (the SSH
  package).

  On Windows pywin32 (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/>) is
  required.  Build 215 or later is highly recommended for reliable operation
  (this is already included in ActivePython).

  If you would like to use Trial's subunit reporter, then you will need to
  install Subunit 0.0.2 or later (https://launchpad.net/subunit).
