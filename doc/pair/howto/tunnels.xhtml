    <h1>Twisted Pair: Tunnels And Network Taps</h1>

    <p>
      On Linux, Twisted Pair supports the special <em>tun</em> and <em>tap</em>.
      This functionality allows you to interact with raw sockets (for example, to send or receive ICMP or ARP traffic).
      It also allows the creation of simulated networks.
      This document will not cover the details of these platform-provided features, but it will explain how to use the Twisted Pair APIs which interact with them.
      Before reading this document, you may want to familiarize yourself with Linux tuntap if you have not already done so.
