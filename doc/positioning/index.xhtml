<h1>Twisted Positioning Documentation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Twisted Positioning is a framework for doing geospatial positioning (trying to find where you are on Earth) using Twisted.
</p>

<h2>High-level overview</h2>
<p>
In Twisted Positioning, you write an <code class="API" base="twisted.positioning.ipositioning">IPositioningReceiver</code> implementation that will get called whenever some information about your position is known (such as position, altitude, heading...). Twisted Positioning provides a base class called BasePositioningReceiver you might want to use that implements all of the receiver methods as stubs.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, you will want a positioning source, which will call your <code class="API" base="twisted.positioning.ipositioning">IPositioningReceiver</code>. Currently, Twisted Positioning provides an NMEA implementation, which is a standard protocol spoken by many positioning devices, usually over a serial port.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="nmealogger.py">nmealogger.py</a> - Connects to an NMEA device on a serial port, and reports whenever it receives a position.</li>
</ul>
