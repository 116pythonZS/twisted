Twisted Conch 13.2.0
====================

Twisted Conch depends on Twisted Core and on `Python Crypto extensions <http://www.pycrypto.org>`_.

The `pyasn1 module <http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net>`_ is also required.

`gmpy <http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/>`_ is strongly recommended to improve performance.

Twisted Conch includes a couple simple GUI applications which depend on Tkinter.
