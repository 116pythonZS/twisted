        An item was received at some lower level interface; progress is being
        made towards the next item that will be passed to 'receive'.

        This method can be implemented in order to facilitate timeout logic.
        For example, if you have a file downloader that might be used to
        download a multi-gigabyte file and then deliver that file's name to an
        L{IDrain}, that L{IDrain} will be waiting a long time to receive that
        one item to C{receive()}.  However, timeout logic usually belongs with
        the ultimate consumer of an API, which in this case would be the
        very-infrequently-called L{IDrain}.  So, that L{IDrain} could implement
        C{progress} to re-set a short timeout, so that it can shut down an idle
        connection that is receiving nothing, but it won't shut down a
        connection that is functioning perfectly well but slightly slower than
        expected.

        @param amount: An optional floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0
            indicating the estimated amount of progress made towards the next
            call to L{receive} on this L{IDrain}.  For example, if an item is
            received in 4 chunks, this would ideally be called with 0.25, 0.5,
            0.75 and 1.0. Note however that this value represents an
            I{estimate} and its exact semantics may vary considerably depending
            on the nature of the underlying transport.  In fact, although
            callers really should remain within the 0.0/1.0 range,
            implementations of this method should be resilient to invalid
            values, and treat any value outside that range as equivalent to
            C{None}.  In many cases, the amount of progress made is entirely
            unknown: for example, when some bytes are received by the
            underlying transport when no length prefix is avialable in the
            transport protocol.  In those cases, C{None} should be passed here.
        @type amount: C{float} or C{NoneType}

class IPump(Interface):

    An L{IPump} provider is a control object for an L{ITube}.  A pump provides
    all the behavior associated with the L{ITube}'s translation of input to

    @note: L{IPump} providers participate in I{data processing} not in I{flow
        control}.  That is to say, an L{IPump} provider can translate its input
        to output, but cannot impact the rate at which that output is
        delivered.  If you want to implement flow-control modifications,
        implement L{IDrain} directly.  L{IDrain} providers may be easily
        connected up to L{IPump} providers with L{series
        <twisted.tubes.tube.series>}, so you may implement flow-control in an
        L{IDrain} that passes on its input unmodified and data-processing in an
        L{IPump} and hook them together.
