# used only for values read from wsgi.input, passed to write() or yielded by
# the application.
#
# Put another way:
#
# - In Python 2, all text strings and binary data are of type str/bytes and
#   NEVER of type unicode. Whether the strings contain binary data or
#   ISO-8859-1 text depends on context.
#
# - In Python 3, all text strings are of type str, and all binary data are of
#   type bytes. Text MUST always be limited to that which can be encoded as
#   ISO-8859-1, U+0000 to U+00FF inclusive.
